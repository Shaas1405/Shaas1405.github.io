                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p style="font-size: 1.2em">
                    I'm Shaas, a friendly and enthusiastic 13-year-old 8th grade
                    student at Amana Academy, deeply passionate about
                    technology, computer hardware, and coding. I've immersed
                    myself in the world of video game development and website
                    creation, constantly exploring new tech trends and diving
                    into projects that challenge my technical skills and
                    creativity. Proficient in JavaScript for dynamic web
                    applications and HTML/CSS for crafting responsive and
                    visually appealing designs, I find joy in the creative
                    process of designing user interfaces and optimizing game
                    mechanics. Collaborating with peers on school projects has
                    further fueled my desire to work with like-minded
                    individuals in the tech industry, where I aim to contribute
                    to innovative projects that push the boundaries of
                    technology. My curiosity to understand the inner workings of
                    computers and their hardware components drives me to
                    continuously learn and grow in this evolving field.

                    Achieving academic excellence at Amana Academy, I
                    consistently earn a place on the Principal Honor Roll with
                    all A's. In martial arts, I've achieved the prestigious
                    Black Belt level in Chung-Moon's Hap-Kido, demonstrating
                    discipline and skill through victories in multiple
                    competitions, including a notable 4th place finish. Outside
                    of academics, my passion for technology has driven me to
                    engage in programs with industry leaders such as Fiserv and
                    Verizon through Amana Academy, where I've gained practical
                    experience and industry insights. At the Georgia State-Level
